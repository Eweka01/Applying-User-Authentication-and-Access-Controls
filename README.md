# Applying-User-Authentication-and-Access-Controls

## Objective
After finishing this lab, attendees will develop a thorough knowledge of how to use Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory Domain Services to set up a strong framework for authentication and access management. They will become skilled in generating new user accounts and security groups in a Windows setting. Additionally, they will master the creation of access control lists to secure objects and folders from unauthorized entries within the Windows platform. Moreover, the differences between Windows Security permissions and Windows Share permissions will be made clear. The skills learned will also include how to set up access controls on a remote file server by utilizing the strengths of Active Directory Security Groups.

## Skills Learned

The following skills were gained through this comprehensive lab:

- **User Account Management**: Learned to set up and manage user accounts and security groups using Active Directory, with a focus on role-based permissions.
- **Access Control Implementation**: Gained expertise in configuring access controls, emphasizing the Principle of Least Privilege to enhance security management.
- **Network-Attached Storage (NAS) Configuration**: Configured TrueNAS and Samba for secure network-attached storage, including the creation of shared folders with specific access control lists (ACLs).
- **Security Integration**: Integrated security measures for newly acquired company groups, ensuring compliance with organizational security policies.
- **Access Control Verification**: Performed meticulous access control verifications to maintain proper permissions and enhance security posture.
- **Final Validation**: Conducted a final validation of TrueNAS permissions to ensure that security measures were properly implemented and aligned with industry standards.


## Tools Used

The following tools were employed in this lab to provide hands-on experience in cybersecurity:

- **Active Directory Users and Computers**: Essential for managing user accounts and security groups within the Active Directory environment, helping participants understand access permissions and policies.
- **PowerShell**: A powerful scripting tool used to automate administrative tasks, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of scripting in system management.
- **TrueNAS**: Network-attached storage (NAS) solution utilized to demonstrate file sharing, data storage, and access control principles, emphasizing the importance of data integrity and access management.
